                    <h2>Gossip of the new world</h2>
                    <h3>Reception at the count Lorem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gossip is idle talk or rumour, especially about the personal or private affairs of others; the act is also known as dishing or tattling.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Gossip is a topic of research in evolutionary psychology, which has found gossip to be an important means for people to monitor cooperative reputations and so maintain widespread indirect reciprocity. Indirect reciprocity is a social interaction in which one actor helps another and is then benefited by a third party. Gossip has also been identified by Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary biologist, as aiding social bonding in large groups.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The term originates from the bedroom at the time of childbirth. Giving birth used to be a social event exclusively attended by women. The pregnant woman's female relatives and neighbours would congregate and idly converse. Over time, gossip came to mean talk of others.

            </div>
            <div id="opinion">
                The truth is that we don’t know what the future holds, no one can predict that. But what we do know is that if we adopt the best lifestyle possible, we can maximise changes and reverse trends. Beyond practical and material impact, this period should also remind us to build upon our resilience to future changes and our solidarity to another.
                <br/><br/>
                Collapsologues and other ‘end of our civilisation’ thinkers believe it will never stop. There have even been claims by spiritual communities that believe we will soon have access to another level of consciousness which will allow us to shift paradigms, reverse power and allow our planet to recover from the destruction we have been making. And then there are others who don’t even think about it at all and continue on with their lives avoiding the reality they read about in the news. 
                <br/><br/>
                The truth is, nobody knows how the future will unfold and we would be fools to pretend we do. We simply cannot anticipate what will happen tomorrow and actually when we do that, not only does it make us foolish by playing god but it also triggers a lot of anxiety. But regardless of whoever is right or wrong, the only thing we can do is grow our inner resilience and to adapt ourselves and to build.
